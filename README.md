# Brain Tumor Detection

This project implements a **brain tumor detection system** using deep learning techniques. It analyzes MRI scan images to classify whether a tumor is present or not, assisting in early diagnosis and medical decision-making.

The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate image classification and provides a scalable solution for medical image analysis.

## Working  

1. MRI images are preprocessed (resizing, normalization)  
2. Images are fed into a trained CNN model  
3. Model extracts features and predicts tumor presence  
4. Output is classified as:  
   - **Tumor Detected**  
   - **No Tumor Detected**
